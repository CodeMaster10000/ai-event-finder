"Before the 2016 election, an album like this might be called a “dystopia”; now we call it “did you see what he tweeted?” On Ostrar’s new album, he weaves together disparate voices, like a non-fiction version of Our Town. ""The Worried Coat"" out April 5th on Super Secret Records, was recorded in part in Mexico City courtesy of Richard Davies (The Moles) hand-me-down studio time and the other half at a ranch in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, Ostrar wrapped and warped his Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar around these groovy nuggets of capitalistic despair, cretinism, gas lighting, nationalism and nativism, false heroism, and that good-time tug-of-war (this game is rigged) called Inherited Wealth vs. Inherited Debt. But he wasn’t alone in making this album, so don’t worry too much about him. He brought along Michael Krassner (Boxhead Ensemble), Wil Hendricks (Califone), and Stephen Patterson (Hamilton Leithauser). 
This is Ostrar’s second solo album, the follow-up to 2017’s Brawls In the Briar. Before that, he led the early 2000 shag-carpet art-punk of Manishevitz, an early Jagjaguwar band that toured with The Mountain Goats and Edith Frost before the Internet tracked these things.

"AdELA is triple-threat. She’s a singer, songwriter, and rapper reaping the benefits of
pursuing her dreams of stardom. The tenacious South African-born, Atlanta-based beauty got her resolve for pursuing the life she wanted from her parents, who left lucrative careers in South Africa in order to escape apartheid in the ‘90s. AdELA’s family first settled in Miami exposing her to all styles of music from Miami Bass, Nas, Tupac, Royce Da 5’9 to Frank Sinatra – artists she describes as “timeless and an inspiration for her own creativity.” AdELA earned her first RIAA Certified Gold credit as a co-writer and performer on Meek Mill’s “Made it From Nothing.” In 2015, AdELA made her official debut with Off the Burner, followed
by her EP Dreamers and Thinkers in 2017, where she decided to feature a well-known rapper on every track. AdELA landed collaborations with Royce Da 5’9, Skyzoo, Torae, Fat Joe, and Kool G Rap just to name a few. Dreamers and Thinkers peaked at number 21 on the iTunes Top 100 in the United States as well as breaking the Top 100 in the UK and France. AdELA’s next mission is breaking into the Top 20 with her latest project entitled, On the Line, set for release in 2019.

"Adrian Jean has led a tumultuous life that’s taken him from the poorest neighborhoods in Philadelphia to glamorous nightclubs, to homelessness and redemption. The soulful Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter channels this past into intimate yet infectious pop-meets- R&B sounds. 
Adrian offers a powerful look at his personal history through anthemic and club-ready tracks such as “Tell The World,” alongside thoughtful songs about identity and acceptance like “Story of Blue.” His yearning, yet polished, gospel-influenced vocals and catchy beats sound as if Adele and Sam Smith produced a statuesque black child with a serious story to tell. 
After several successful years singing Top 40 covers and standards across the country, Adrian decided to focus on his own music and developed Caged Bird. Adrian has performed his music as a five piece band as part of a two month residency series at the inaugural US multimedia exhibition The Velvet Underground Experience, which opened in New York City on Oct. 10.

"AKAW! started as a 3 piece garage/surf rock band back in 2017 on a bet that they couldn't nail a full set within 2 weeks. Of course the guys got it together and had a great time playing together. AKAW! immediately started to incorporate choreography, sound effects and a stylish uniform to their performance to make it a SHOW, not just 3 dudes standing around playing garage rock. The AKAW! call seems to follow the members around, usually being yelled immediately upon entering the venue at load in or when the members are seen at other shows.

"Every song from Alex Di Leo is an automatic escape from day-to-day life, a retreat into a state of mind that’s more hopeful and carefree and full of possibility. With his soulful vocals and crystalline melodies, the Fort Lauderdale-based singer/songwriter delivers an impassioned breed of indie-pop that melts away everyday worries and leaves the listener inspired to live more fearlessly.
Given their transportive power, it’s fitting that so many of Di Leo’s songs are sparked by his adventures in visiting new cities all over the country and across the globe. “I’m always most motivated to write when I’m in a place I’ve never been before,” says the 22-year-old artist. “Even just riding on the plane when I’m traveling somewhere new seems to do something to me, and the melodies just start to come together.”
On his new EP Strange Open Land, Di Leo channels that inspiration into an intricately detailed but hook-heavy sound. The follow-up to his debut EP So We Go—a 2016 release that landed Di Leo on the top 20 at more than 100 college radio stations around the U.S.—the EP also perfectly captures the infectious energy that Di Leo’s shown in sharing stages with such artists as Barns Courtney

It’s the culmination of experience, both musical and rawly human, that makes Altameda the band they are. Hitting festival circuits and stages across Canada and the UK, they’ve toured extensively since releasing their much-celebrated debut album, Dirty Rain.

"It was 2014, and for the first time, Amy Wilcox felt her musical dreams were finally within her grasp. Years spent honing her craft as a songwriter and performer had finally brought her to this point – she was about to head out on her first national tour. She had been opening for Nashville staples like Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, Kellie Pickler, and Brothers Osborne, while also commanding her own residency at Nashville mainstay, Third & Lindsley. As a principle character on A&E’s reality show, Crazy Hearts, the world got its first glimpse into the life of the burgeoning country music starlet. But just as Amy’s music was beginning to connect, life got in the way. Her engagement was called off, her future plans dissolved, and the turmoil brewing in Amy’s personal life crept into her craft. “I learned the hard way that not everything is meant to be. Sometimes timing is everything. After the dust settled, I struggled to reconnect creatively. I was in a very different place, and honestly it was really tough,” Amy recalls. Her relationship went south, but instead of dwelling on what might have been, Amy picked herself up and headed West, on a new journey of personal and artistic growth. L

"It’s safe to say, nobody has partied harder, longer, or more fervently than the undisputed King of Partying himself, Andrew W.K.. The party music mission he embarked upon in 1999, and solidified in 2001 with the release of his signature hard rock tune “Party Hard”, remains unswervingly consistent, while also adopting a dizzying array of roles that took him into unusual territory for a rock ’n’ roll musician. These include being an advice columnist for the Village Voice and Vice Magazine, the host of a Cartoon Network children's game show, and giving motivational lectures on positive partying at Yale, NYU, Carnegie Mellon, and the U.K.'s Oxford University. As the prodigious piano playing party prophet nears his second decade of dynamic performance, his hard partying spirit shows no signs of slowing... or softening.

"Hatched in the tradition of Southern culture—unhurried in his art, yet weirdly ahead of the curve by the time he arrives— Andy Jenkins is a joyously idiosyncratic songwriting talent, ripened over years of relative obscurity. 'Sweet Bunch' springs into the world fully-formed, sitting at the crossroads of modernism and timelessness, sensitivity and decision, with the expansiveness and musical drawl of Big Star, the bounce of John Prine, and the curly, perfectly-carved melodies of George Harrison. Each song paints a wild landscape, the mood of a sun setting on a damn good day among friends and favored creatures.
 
Andy is a kind of unheard counterpoint, originating from the same small scene of independent Virginia youth culture that produced artists like Justin Frye (PC Worship) Natalie Prass, and Matthew E. White, all friends from his teenage years. Produced by longtime collaborator White, with the Spacebomb crew and another old friend, Phil Cook, running hard into midnight, 'Sweet Bunch' was essentially recorded in three days of flow-state, with the drums, bass, keys, and guitars all live and nothing to regret. Backed by some ringers and a very full chorus, Andy’s warm words come bu

"In Donald Trump’s America, being a Latina from East LA, living in the South (Richmond, Virginia) is just about as close to the political bone as you can get. Angelica Garcia lends her astonishing voice to her poetically woven musings and statements of intent. In a time when music should stand up and isn’t, she’s an old head on young shoulders and a total anomaly.
After an unhappy period with a major label, 24-year-old Garcia has had a fantastic grounding in what not to do and has spent the past 2 years plotting her own sound and vision. The first fruits of her labour, the single ‘Karma The Knife” drifted out recently winning over people drawn to her beat-driven, sharp and persistently melodic pop music.  She’s extremely hard to compare, but there’s certainly elements of Beck, The Beastie Boys, Jack White and Kimbra all through Garcia’s particular kaleidoscopic worldview. 
An album is close to completion and is expected in early 2019.

"Loaded with pulsating hooks and enigmatic tenacious vocals, Annabel Allum oozes charisma and showcases an adept ability to marry folk-style storytelling with snarling fuzzy indie. The Guildford-based singer-songwriter
has been backed across tastemaker platforms as one of the most vitally sarcastic voices in the indie scene, with praise coming from key press voices in The Independent, the Fader and The Line of Best Fit as well as on the airwaves. ‘Beat the Birds’, taken from 2018’s ‘Sorry I’m Not Perceptible’ EP, found its place on the Radio 1 BBC Introducing Playlist and she earned herself a spot on the lineup of BBC Music’s The Biggest Weekend in Swansea. Huw Stephens is a vocal supporter of Annabel’s music and premiered her latest single ‘Fear Naught’ ahead of her Maida Vale live session. 'Fear Naught' also featured on Spotify's New Music Friday editorial playlist.
2018 saw Annabel perform at the likes of Boardmasters, Siren Festival, Neverworld and Reading Festival, and she embarked on her first UK headline tour on which she played her biggest headline show to date at The Moth Club in London. 2019 started with Allum heading into the studio to work on new material.

"Listen to any of Apre’s music – be it Without Your Love’s shimmering, celestial bounce; the liquid grooves and clean lines of All Yours; or the widescreen pop cloudburst that is Don’t You Feel Like Heaven? -  and it’s likely your first impression wouldn’t be that all these songs have their roots in the backroom of a West London chess club. But that’s exactly where Apre’s story begins.  

Charlie Brown and Jules Konieczny were no strangers to making music individually, but it wasn’t until Sue who runs Ealing chess club (or, to use her full title “this legend called Sue”) suggested they should hook up and work together that the strands that make up Apre’s unique sound started to fuse together.

“She knew that we shared this passion for music and she paired us up,” recalls Brown, “we started playing together and found this love for the same thing.”

However, things didn’t quite immediately leap forwards from that moment to where we are today. Three years passed and Brown and Konieczn would spend their days playing in other groups, producing, working on other people’s material, making ends meet and trying to find their way in music. But something special kept bringing them back to t

"Ari Chi is a singer, songwriter, instrumentalist & producer born in Atlanta and raised in Tampa, FL. Ari has been cultivating her passion for music since her formal training in high school, and took that to new heights when she decided to pick up the ukulele after a short stint with a guitar--unlike the guitar, she could take the ukulele everywhere. 
Ari began uploading acoustic covers to YouTube in 2013, and developed her skill by practicing daily. That work paid off when Ari’s cover of “Timmy Turner” went viral and landed her some groove time with Desiigner on MTV’s “Critique My Cover”. 
Ari's inspirations include the likes of Ms. Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, and Erykah Badu. However, her eclectic style is genre-bending--mixing folk, soul, r&b, and trap to produce a sound all her own.

"Aries is the solo electronic project of Isabel Fernandez, known as a composer and recording artist in band Charades, touring background vocalist for Delorean, as well as for her singing on Cartoon Network’s ""Adventure Time"". Isabel has been disobeying music all her life but it was in 2011, when she started her solo career, when we discovered that inside her head there was a melodic, kaleidoscopic, punk and unpredictable universe. A world in which Brian Wilson –in the melodies– and Leon Tolstoi –in the law-breaking final message– could happily walk hand in hand dancing to electronic rhythms. She called this personal project Aries (her zodiac sign) and under this identity she has already produced four albums. The latest one, “Juramento Mantarraya”, released by Spanish label La Castanya and K Records, is full of beautiful melodies, seemingly convoluted but at the same time very simple, where violins and flutes are mixed with abstract sounds. Aries creates an orchestra that generates an exciting mixture of free-jazz, soul and folk rhythms, melodies from the girl groups of the 60s, sunshine pop and experimental electronics.

"It’s a romantic cliché to find an escape in music and the blues, but living that life is a different matter. Ask Arkansas Dave about growing up in a broken home, with fundamental Christianity on one side, and crippling drug-addiction on the other, and you can see in his eyes that this is no easy ride, and that at times music really was his only friend.
Chasing his dream of music, Dave played in bands, funding his music with a succession of jobs where he had to find his feet quickly – from busboy to assembly-worker in a trash-bag factory.
His wake up call came at the edge of a breakdown with a cataclysmic weekend epiphany. He headed home for a rare visit, and was persuaded to play a few songs to his family. The response he got from his grandfather sent his mind racing, only for him to find out the next week that his grandfather had died 24 hours later.
Determined to clean himself up, and sort his life, Arkansas Dave enrolled on an audio engineering course at Media Tech in Austin Texas, driving into town with a trailer loaded with all his possessions, ‘like something out of the Beverly Hillbillies’. And that’s where everything changed – the college was housed at that time in the f

His debut ""Trespasser"" (released Oct. 12th, Paper Bag Records) was a dynamic shot from nowhere - received with universal critical acclaim and wide-eyed wonder.  “Trespasser is not just chock full of swaggering rock ’n’ roll tunes that find the common ground between T. Rex, Sparks, Deerhunter and Ziggy Stardust and run with it in wholly satisfying fashion, but those songs are delivered by an enigmatic and elaborately attired auteur who takes the time to cultivate a proper peacock mystique alongside the music. Canadian indie-rock could use a bit more of that.” - The Toronto Star

"Somewhere on a dusty road or a well traveled interstate, right at this very moment, a rock n’ roll band is pounding the rock. They’re probably wearing the same clothes they had on yesterday, and reminiscing about last night’s gig. Inspired by a guitar lick that cuts to the bone or a melody that lingers on refrain, this band is following a path forged by countless other musicians who’ve lived and died in dive bars or ‘made it’ with their posters taped to bedroom walls. What makes this band of brothers any different? This band is The Artisanals. 
When Johnny Delaware moved from small town South Dakota to Charleston, SC he met Clay Houle and bassist Eric Mixon to form The Artisanals in late 2016. Now, with drummer Nick Recio, and keyboardist Ian Klin rounding out the group, The Artisanals have dropped the first ever record to come out of the Magic Barn - an Iowa studio-converted-barn that features the Neve console and gear from NYC's now defunct Magic Shop Studio. Utilizing everything from gong, organ, piano, sitar, french horn, trombone, and koto, to a string section sourced from a nearby University, every song on 'The Artisanals' (Sept 2018) self-titled LP is a straight banger.

"It’s been over two decades since the songwriter packed his bags and left Bloomington, Indiana, the Midwestern town where he spent his childhood years falling in love with rock n’ roll, embracing his punk roots, and standing his ground whenever intolerant locals didn’t understand his way of life. He returns to that place—both creatively and physically—with his latest album, Immortal Americans. Written after a tumultuous period that found Lucas getting sober, supporting his partner through a battle with cancer, and breaking up with his longtime record label, Immortal Americans is a clear-eyed album for murkier times, rooted in stripped-down heartland rock songs that find the artist reflecting upon the changes in both his hometown and himself. It’s also Lucas at his most honest, rooted in a string of largely unamplified anthems that don’t rely on electricity to pack a punch. “I was watching the changes in Bloomington and reflecting upon the changes in my own life,” he sums up.“ Not all of this is happy stuff, but there’s hope. There’s light in the darkness. I really do believe in second and third chances, because I know how many chances I’ve received. You have to keep fighting.""
